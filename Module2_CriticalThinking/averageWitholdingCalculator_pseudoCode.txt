Option #1: Calculate Average Withholding
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Create a program that will calculate the weekly average tax withholding for a
customer given the following weekly income guidelines:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Income less than $500: tax rate 10%
Incomes greater than/equal to $500 and less than $1500: tax rate 15%
Incomes greater than/equal to $1500 and less than $2500: tax rate 20%
Incomes greater than/equal to $2500: tax rate 30%

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Compile and submit your pseudocode, source code, and screenshots of the 
application executing the application, the results and GIT repository in a
single document.

// Pseudo code.

contant CALCULATION_FAILED = -1;

doubble income = CALCULATION_FAILED;
double taxWitheld = CALCULATION_FAILED;

print Welcome to The Average Tax Witholding Calculator.
print    enter your weekly income:

income = input;

if (income < $500)
    taxWitheld = 10% income
else if (incomes >= $500 && income < $1500) 
    taxWitheld = 15% income
else if (incomes >= $1500 && income < $2500)
    taxWitheld = 20% income
else 
    taxWitheld = 30% income

print With and income of: $income

print Tax Witheld per week: $taxWitheld
print Tax Witheld per month: $($taxWitheld * 4)
